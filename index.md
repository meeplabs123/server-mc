## How to start
First, set a new environment variable called 'NGROK' with your ngrok authtoken as the value. You'll get your authtoken [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com).

Next, set another called 'DISCORD' with a discord bot token as the value. You can create a bot [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Now, you need to start the server, run the file named 'start.bash' for a fully automated run. This includes hosting a local server with the server ip as the content, and your discord bot showing the ip as it's status.

**That's It! You server is up and running.**
